# Triggerscope
Micro-Manager-specific firmware for the Triggerscope.

The Triggerscope (http://arc.austinblanco.com/product/triggerscope-3/) 
is an Arduino-based device build and sold by "Advanced Research Consulting" 
(https://arc.austinblanco.com/) that provides analog and digital outputs.  

This firmware - in combination with the Micro-Manager "TriggerscopeMM" device adapter, 
allows for control of 16 analog and 16 digital outputs.  Outputs can 
transition between settings triggered by a Trigger input 
signal at micro-second time scales.  For full documentation
of the use of this firmare, see: https://micro-manager.org/wiki/TriggerScopeMM
