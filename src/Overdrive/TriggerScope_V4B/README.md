# Installation
This firmware is intended for TriggerScope V4B boards (serial numbers 2118 and later).

To install this firmware, you will first need to download and install the [TeensyDuino package](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html), and the  [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Then power your TriggerScope, connect the USB cable to your computer, and open the file TriggerScope_613MM/TriggerScope_613MM.ino in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Select the port under which your device appears (Tools > Port), and select the Teensy 4.1 (Tools > Board). Press the "verify" button, and - if compilation succeeds - press the Upload button.
